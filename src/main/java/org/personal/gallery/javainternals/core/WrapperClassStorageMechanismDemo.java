/****
 *
 * when you write `Integer a = 127;`, it is internally equivalent to calling `Integer.valueOf(127)`.
 * This behavior is part of autoboxing, which is a feature in Java that automatically converts primitive data types to their
 * corresponding wrapper objects when needed. Autoboxing simplifies the process of converting between primitives and their object representations.
 *
 * So, `Integer a = 127;` is effectively the same as `Integer a = Integer.valueOf(127);`.
 * The `Integer.valueOf(int)` method is responsible for caching commonly used values within a certain range, which includes the value `127`
 * as part of the range of cached values for `Integer`.
 * This means that `a` will reference an existing cached `Integer` object if the value falls within the cacheable range.
 * If the value is outside that range, a new `Integer` object will be created.
